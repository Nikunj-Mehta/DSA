# 📘 Java Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

A curated collection of Java implementations for fundamental and advanced **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.  
This repository serves as my learning log, interview preparation toolkit, and problem-solving practice hub.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains well-structured Java programs covering a variety of DSA topics.  
Each implementation focuses on clarity, efficiency, and adherence to standard coding practices.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- **Arrays** – Traversals, searching, sorting, manipulation
- **Recursion** – Backtracking, divide & conquer approaches
- **Linked Lists** – Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists
- **Stacks & Queues** – Array-based and linked list-based implementations
- **Trees** – Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals
- **Graphs** – BFS, DFS, adjacency list/matrix representations
- **Hashing** – HashMaps, HashSets
- **Sorting Algorithms** – Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick sort
- **Searching Algorithms** – Linear and Binary search
